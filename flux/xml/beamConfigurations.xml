<!-- Configurations for GNuMI flux  
     Each is grouped into a <param_set> that are parsed and applied to 
     GNuMIFlux.  Elements should appear in the following order:

     <verbose> : how noisy to be while parsing <param_set>
     <units>   : sets user coordinate units (e.g. "cm", "meter", etc)
                 set this first and only once
     <beamdir> : defines the relative orientation of the beam in user coord
                 three types are currently supported:
           "series"    : a sequence of rotations around one axis at a time
                         each <rotation> needs value and attributes:
                             axis ('x','y','z') units ('deg' 'rad')
           "thetaphi3" : 3 pairs of (theta,phi) ala GEANT3
                         needs 6 values and attribute: units
           "newxyz"    : 3 direction vectors, ala Geant4
                         needs 9 values (will normalize each vector)
     <beampos> :  define the beam origin in the user coordinate system
                  3 values define the point 
                  if 6 values treat as ( user xyz ) = ( beam xyz )
                  but must have set <beamdir> first
     <window> :   define the flux window via three <point> elements
                  each <point> is a user coord (x,y,z)
     <enumax>:    set limits on the maximum enu energy:  lowlimit, fudgefactor
                  set limits on wgt: fudgefactor, # points to use
                  final reported energy is max(lowlimit,fudgefactor*enumxscan)
                  where is 'enumxscan' is the highest energy seen when 
                  scanning for x-y weights.
     <reuse>:     set # of times an entry is sequentially reused
     <upstreamz>: user coord z to push neutrino orgin to
                  if abs(z) > 1e30 then leave on the flux window 
                              
     The units, beamdir, beampos elements define the user coordinate system 
        user_dir =  rot * beam_dir
        user_pos = (rot * beam_pos ) + user_pos_beamorigin
     If more than one <beamdir> or <beampos> is specified the last
     one of each is used.  Results of rotations from <beamdir> elements
     are not cummulative.
            
     Parsing of element contents w/ multiple values is liberal about
     spacing, line breaks, grouping and separating characters.
